# Independent-Study-ECE592

This summer course is part of the independent study offered by Prof. Mehmet Baysan from Istanbul Sehir University. During this summer study, I intend to learn enough material to make a considerable progress for my final year Master thesis of Automatically annotating cancer mutations using public databases.
