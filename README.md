# Independent-Study-ECE592

This summer course is part of the independent study offered by Prof. Mehmet Baysan from Istanbul Sehir University. During this summer study, I intend to learn enough material to make a considerable progress for my final year Master thesis of Automatically annotating cancer mutations using public databases.

Week 2:Vcf format specifications detail study <br />
Week 3:Literature Review on different types of Annotations <br />
Week 4:Perform, generate and infer Annotation type 1 <br />
Week 5:Perform, generate and infer Annotation type 2 <br />
Week 6:Perform, generate and infer Annotation type 3 <br />
Week 7:Create Visualizations for the 3 types of Annotations performed <br />
Week 8:SIFT Algorithm study <br />
Week 9:PolyPhen Algorithm study <br />
Week 10:PhDSNP & SNAP Algorithm study <br />
Week 11:MutPred Machine Learning based Algorithm study <br />
Week 12:CHASM method <br />
