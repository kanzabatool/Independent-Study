Week 3:Literature Review on different types of Annotations
Week 4:Perform, generate and infer Annotation type 1
Week 5:Perform, generate and infer Annotation type 2
Week 6:Perform, generate and infer Annotation type 3
Week 7:Create Visualizations for the 3 types of Annotations performed
Week 8:SIFT Algorithm study
Week 9:PolyPhen Algorithm study
Week 10:PhDSNP & SNAP Algorithm study
Week 11:MutPred Machine Learning based Algorithm study
Week 12:CHASM method
Week 13:Aggregate information of publicly available databases for annotation of cancer mutations
Week 14:Identify best practices and performance evaluation for each practice
Week 15:Formulate Thesis project implementation outline
